## ðŸ“– Research & Experimental Projects

### VR Exergames for Yoga & HIIT
I am developing virtual realityâ€“based exergames aimed at promoting consistent engagement with yoga and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). By integrating motion tracking and real-time posture detection, these exergames provide immersive, adaptive workout routines to accommodate various skill levels. The goal is to demonstrate how VR can enhance motivation and long-term adherence to healthy exercise habits.

### BCI & Mixed Reality Concerts
This project explores the fusion of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and Mixed Reality to create immersive concert experiences. By capturing performersâ€™ emotional and neural states, I aim to build an environment that transforms in real time to reflect the raw, unfiltered emotions of the artist. This approach aspires to offer a one-of-a-kind audiovisual spectacle, blending cutting-edge technology with live performance art.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### OpsManCTF  
- **Description:** A Bhagavad Gita themed Capture the Flag (CTF) platform designed to encourage juniors to learn Git version control, including techniques such as cherry-picking and commits.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Self-hosted website with an executable built using Python and PyInstaller that pushes user progress to a server to display a live leaderboard.  
  - Main application built with Next.js, with hidden levels embedded in Git commits within a GitHub repository.  
  - Incorporates 4 levels employing steganography techniques to conceal keys, complemented by artistic clues drawn from episodes of the Bhagavad Gita.

### RMDS Prototype  
- **Description:** A prototype developed to demonstrate the speed, ease of use, and viability of modern front-end frameworks in building a Remote Monitoring and Diagnostics Software interface.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Frontend built using React and Next.js, showcasing modern UI development practices with ShadCN components for modularity and customization.  
  - Backend continuously polls MongoDB for sensor values when an event stream is established and pushes updates using server-sent events (SSE).  
  - Secured API routes with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), including endpoints for role creation, actor authorization, and data aggregation for statistical inferences with caching mechanisms.  
  - Comprehensive data validation across backend inputs to ensure robust operations and secure data handling.

### Colosseum  
- **Description:** A comprehensive, SaaS-based, game agnostic e-sports tournament hosting platform developed as part of academic requirements in a collaborative team of five.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Leveraged **Next.js** to create a fast, SEO-friendly interface, achieving a 35% reduction in page load times.  
  - Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on both the backend and frontend, with API documentation and testing powered by **SwaggerUI**.  
  - Developed an admin dashboard featuring real-time charts using the **Recharts** library, along with report functionality and robust admin controls.  
  - Engineered an engaging landing page utilizing **GSAP** with scroll-trigger animations and parallax effects, enhanced by a dynamic canvas cursor from the **cursify** library.  
  - Designed and prototyped monetization features to support paid tournaments and sponsor integrations.

### CMNTR | Python (2024)
- **Description:** A specialized note-taking and retrieval application tailored for code-mixed Telugu-English users.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Utilized Random Indexing and BERT models for AutoSuggestion and context-aware text retrieval, enabling lightweight online learning of user-specific data patterns.  
  - Built a robust Command Line Interface (CLI) with the Click library, streamlining user interactions across diverse use cases.  
  - Enhanced retrieval speeds, achieving a 20% improvement compared to initial iterations.  
  - Integrated thorough data handling to accommodate the unique challenges of code-mixed language usage.
